# Arch Linux Installation Scripts
## `archinstall.sh` - my personal Arch Linux install/setup scripts
* Inspired by <https://github.com/Bugswriter/arch-linux-magic>
* Scripts assume:
    * an active internet connection
    * a booted "archiso" live environment
    * A US keyboard layout
    * And my personal configuration preferences (of course)
